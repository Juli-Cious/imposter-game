# 🎥 Imposter Game: Official Video Presentation Script
**Time Limit:** 5 Minutes (Strict)
**Goal:** Sell the solution, the tech, and the impact.

### **1. Introduction & The "Hook" (0:00 - 0:45)**
**(Visual: Title Slide -> Cut to black/white image of a massive data center emitting smoke -> Graph of rising energy costs)**

**Speaker:**
"Hi, we are **Team [Insert Team Name]**, and we’re presenting **Imposter Game**."
"We are addressing **SDG 13: Climate Action** by tackling a problem effective at the source: **Dirty Code.**"
"Did you know that data centers consume **1% of global electricity**? That’s more than the entire airline industry. Every day, thousands of students graduate coding bootcamps knowing how to write code that *works*, but not code that is *efficient*."
"We are teaching the next generation to be 'Green Coders' before they ever deploy a single line of code to production."

### **2. Solution Overview & Tech Stack (0:45 - 1:30)**
**(Visual: Slide showing "Imposter Game" Logo -> CUT TO: Full System Architecture Diagram (React <-> Firebase <-> Gemini))**

**Speaker:**
"Our solution, **Imposter Game**, is a multiplayer social deduction platform—think 'Among Us' meets 'LeetCode'—where players must fix inefficient algorithms to save a facility’s power grid."
"It’s not just a game; it’s a full-stack educational platform powered by Google Technology:"
1.  "**Google Gemini Pro API:** This is the brain of our 'Chaos Engine,' generating infinite unique levels and analyzing code efficiency in real-time."
2.  "**Firebase Realtime Database:** This powers our low-latency multiplayer syncing, instant sabotage updates, and live leaderboard."
3.  "**React & web Vitals:** Ensuring a smooth, performant experience on any device."

### **3. The Live Demo (1:30 - 4:00) *CRITICAL SECTION***
**(Visual: Screen recording of the actual game. NO SLIDES.)**

**[1:30 - 2:15] The "Chaos Engine" & Level Generation**
*   **Action:** Click "Start Game". Show the loading screen generating a level.
    *   *EDITOR NOTE: Pre-record this and SPEED UP the loading spinner in post-production. Do not make the judges wait.*
*   **Speaker:** "Let’s jump in. I’ll start a single-player training mode. Right now, the **Gemini API** is actively generating a unique coding challenge based on 'Array Manipulation'. It’s injecting a specific O(n²) inefficiency—a nested loop that doesn't need to be there."

**[2:15 - 3:00] Gameplay & "Green Coder Score"**
*   **Action:** Player opens the Code Editor terminal. Showing the bad code.
*   **Speaker:** "Here is the corrupted code. A standard compiler would say this is 'Correct' because it produces the right output. But our **Green Coder Analysis**—powered by Gemini—flags it."
*   **Action:** Player attempts a fix (maybe gets it wrong first). Show **Professor Gaia** popping up.
*   **Speaker:** "I’m stuck. I’ll ask **Professor Gaia**, our specific AI mentor persona. Notice it doesn't give me the answer; it gives me a conceptual hint about 'Time Complexity'."

**[3:00 - 4:00] Victory & Multiplayer Sabotage**
*   **Action:** Player optimizes the code (removes nested loop). Submits. Show the Victory Screen with "Green Coder Score".
*   **Speaker:** "I’ve optimized the loop. I submit... and success! The game translates my O(n) optimization into: 'You saved enough energy to charge 50 smartphones'."
*   **Action:** **CUT TO: Multiplayer Gameplay. Screen turns RED with a "SABOTAGED" alert.**
*   **Speaker:** "But the real challenge is Multiplayer. Here you see an 'Imposter' weaponizing this inefficiency. They’ve injected a syntax error into my terminal in real-time using Firebase listeners, forcing me to debug under pressure while the facility power drains."

### **4. Impact & Validation (4:00 - 4:45)**
**(Visual: Slide with photos of user testing/graphs)**

**Speaker:**
"We didn't just build this; we tested it with **12 coding students** aged 10-14."
"The results were clear:"
*   "**85%** of students understood the concept of 'Green Coding' after just one session, up from 15%."
*   "And critically, **100%** could identify an energy-wasting nested loop."
"We are currently prototyping Phase 2: A mobile version with Flutter to reach students in developing regions without high-end laptops."

### **5. Conclusion (4:45 - 5:00)**
**(Visual: Final Slide with Team Name & Call to Action)**

**Speaker:**
"In summary, **Imposter Game** uses Google Gemini to turn the abstract concept of algorithmic efficiency into a tangible, urgent mission."
"We aren't just playing games. We’re creating a future where every developer is a Climate Activist."
"Thank you for watching."
